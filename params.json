{"body":"API-Libraries\r\n=============\r\n\r\nWelcome to the client Libraries for the elefunds API.\r\n\r\nBe sure to checkout `Documentation/GettingStarted.md` for a general introduction into the elefunds API, before you\r\ngo ahead to the language of your choice.\r\n\r\nThe API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the libaries are a great help and timesaver! However, if your language\r\nis not supported yet, be sure that we work hard to provide it for you. If you need therefore reference material (e.g. HTML,\r\nCSS or Javascript Snippets), be sure to contact us at `hello@elefunds.de` and we'll find a soltution.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nThe elefunds IT-Crowd\r\n","google":"","tagline":"SDK and Documentation for the elefunds API","note":"Don't delete this file!
