elefunds API SDK v1.3.0
=======================

Welcome to the elefunds API SDK.

Be sure to checkout the the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/elefunds/elefunds-SDK/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
for a general introduction to the elefunds API, before moving on to the language of your choice.

The API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the SDKs are a great help and timesaver! If your language
is not supported yet, contact us at <hello@elefunds.de> and we'll help you get started.

Best,  
the elefunds team
