Elefunds API SDK's
==================

Welcome to the elefunds API.

Be sure to checkout the the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/elefunds/elefunds-SDK/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
for a general introduction into the elefunds API, before you go ahead to the language of your choice.

The API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the SDKs are a great help and timesaver! However, if your language
is not supported yet, be sure that we work hard to provide it for you. If you need therefore reference material (e.g. HTML,
CSS or Javascript Snippets), be sure to contact us at <hello@elefunds.de> and we'll find a soltution.
