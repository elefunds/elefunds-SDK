API-Libraries
=============

Welcome to the client Libraries for the elefunds API.

Be sure to checkout `Documentation/GettingStarted.md` for a general introduction into the elefunds API, before you
go ahead to the language of your choice.

The API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the libaries are a great help and timesaver! However, if your language
is not supported yet, be sure that we work hard to provide it for you. If you need therefore reference material (e.g. HTML,
CSS or Javascript Snippets), be sure to contact us at `hello@elefunds.de` and we'll find a soltution.

Best
