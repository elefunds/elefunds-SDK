elefunds API SDK v2.0
=====================

Welcome to the elefunds API SDK.

Be sure to checkout the the [Getting Started Guide](Documentation/API/GettingStarted.md)
for a general introduction to the elefunds API, before moving on to the language of your choice.

The API itself is (naturally) language agnostic, but the SDKs are a great help and timesaver! If your language
is not supported yet or you're just interested in reference material (ie. HTML, CSS or Javascript snippets), be sure to contact us at <hello@elefunds.de> and we'll find a solution.

Best,  
the elefunds team
